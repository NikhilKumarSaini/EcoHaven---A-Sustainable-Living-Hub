## About The Project
As the global population becomes increasingly aware of environmental issues, the demand for sustainable living solutions grows. However, many individuals struggle to find a cohesive platform that both educates and provides actionable steps toward an eco-conscious lifestyle.

In the face of growing environmental challenges, from climate change to resource depletion, the need for sustainable living has become more urgent than ever. Individuals, communities, and businesses are increasingly seeking ways to reduce their environmental impact, yet access to clear, actionable information and tools remains limited.

The **Sustainable Living Hub** is designed to address this gap by creating a comprehensive digital platform that empowers users to adopt more sustainable lifestyles. The Sustainable Living Hub seeks to address this problem by offering an all-in-one solution where users can:
- Learn about sustainability through a well-structured blog section
- Purchase eco-friendly products through a community-driven marketplace
- Participate in discussions and share tips in a community forum

By combining these features, the platform creates a supportive environment that encourages users to transition into a more sustainable lifestyle. Through this project, I aim to demonstrate a deep understanding of full-stack development, including user experience design, backend architecture, database management, and API integration.

## Tech Stack
Currently, two official plugins are available:
- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## ESLint Configuration
If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type aware lint rules:

- Configure the top-level `parserOptions` property like this:
```js
export default tseslint.config({
  languageOptions: {
    // other options...
    parserOptions: {
      project: ['./tsconfig.node.json', './tsconfig.app.json'],
      tsconfigRootDir: import.meta.dirname,
    },
  },
})
